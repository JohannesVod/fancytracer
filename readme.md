A tiny fast raytracer written in plain C with almost no dependencies which supports basic materials.

TODOS:
- faster tracing through scene by calculating triangle voxel intersections for every triangle/voxel
- better tone mapping (filmic, ... ?)
- more materials
- better raytracing that reduces noise, for example importance sampling
